# Trinity

**A Game of Tycoons, Landmarks, and Hostile Takeovers**

*2–4 Players | 30–45 Minutes | Ages 10+*

## About

Trinity is a tile-placement strategy board game where players compete as rival tycoons racing to dominate a booming city. Build your real estate empire by strategically placing **Housing**, **Commerce**, and **Industry** tiles on an 8×8 city grid.

When you connect all three tile types, you create a **Landmark**—a monument to your success. But beware: rival tycoons eye the same plots. When negotiation fails, deploy your **Agents** to secure your holdings or execute hostile takeovers of competitors' assets.

When the board is full, the tycoon with the most Landmarks wins.

## Key Features

- **Perfect Information**: All tiles in hand are visible—plan and counter-plan accordingly
- **Engine Building**: Landmarks grant bonus tile draws, accelerating your growth
- **Tactical Combat**: Convert Landmarks to Headquarters to deploy Agents for offense or defense
- **Risk vs Reward**: Headquarters provide Agents but don't count toward victory
