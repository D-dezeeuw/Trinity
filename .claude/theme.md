### Flavor

> New York, 1955. The Five Families have carved up the city, but peace never lasts. You're the head of one of the families, hungry to expand your territory. Tenements for loyalty. Fronts for legitimacy. Rackets for cash. Control all three in a neighborhood, and it's yours—Turf with your name on it. But the other families want the same blocks. When negotiation fails, you send your associates. Just remember: mob wars bring heat, and heat burns everyone.

### Tone

- Period-authentic slang and phrasing
- Respect and violence intertwined
- "It's just business"
