# TRINITY
### A Game of Tycoons, Landmarks, and Hostile Takeovers
*2–4 Players | 30–45 Minutes | Ages 10+*

---

## The Story

A new city rises from nothing—prime real estate, untapped potential, and room for empires to be built. You are one of several ambitious tycoons who have arrived to stake your claim. To dominate, you must master the balance of **Housing**, **Commerce**, and **Industry**—the sacred Trinity of urban development. Connect all three, and a **Landmark** rises in your name: a museum, a stadium, a monument to your success.

But you are not alone. Rival tycoons eye the same plots, the same glory. When negotiation fails, you dispatch your **Agents**—lawyers, fixers, specialists who operate in the spaces between contracts. They secure your holdings, and when necessary, execute hostile takeovers of your competitors' assets. But be warned: when agents clash, the courts get involved, settlements drag on for years, and everyone loses.

When the last plot is claimed, only the tycoon with the most Landmarks will be remembered. The city forgets the rest.

## Components

- 1 City Board (8×8 grid)
- 72 Development Tiles (24 Housing, 24 Commerce, 24 Industry)
  - *Each tile is double-sided with an Agent emblem on the reverse*
- 36 Event Cards
- This Rulebook

## Overview

Players expand their real estate empires by placing development tiles on the board. When three specific tiles—**Housing**, **Commerce**, and **Industry**—are connected, they form a **Landmark** and stack together, freeing up space and earning the player an Event card. Landmarks can be converted into **Headquarters** (deploying Agents) for protection or hostile takeovers, but at a cost: Headquarters don't count toward victory. When the board is full, the player with the most Landmarks wins.

## Setup

1. **Prepare the Stacks**
   - Shuffle all 72 Development Tiles face-down to form the **D. Stack** (Development Stack).
   - Shuffle the Event Cards face-down to form the **E. Stack** (Event Stack).

2. **Determine Starting Positions**
   - **2 Players:** Sit on opposite sides of the board. Your starting zone is the two rows closest to you.
   - **3–4 Players:** Each player claims a corner of the board as their starting zone.

3. **Determine Starting Player**
   - Each player draws 1 tile from the D. Stack.
   - Housing beats Commerce beats Industry. The player with the highest tile goes first.
   - If tied, tied players draw again.
   - All drawn tiles are placed on the bottom of the D. Stack.

4. **Draw Starting Hands**
   - Each player draws **5 tiles** from the D. Stack.
   - **Open Hand:** All tiles in hand are kept face-up and visible to all players. This is a game of perfect information—plan and counter-plan accordingly.

5. **Mulligan (Optional)**
   - If you are unhappy with your starting hand, you may shuffle it back into the D. Stack and draw 5 new tiles. Each player may mulligan **once**.

6. **Draft Starting Events**
   - Deal 2 Event cards face-down to each player.
   - Each player looks at their cards and chooses 1 to keep, then passes the other face-down to the player on their left.
   - Each player keeps the card passed to them.
   - Both cards remain face-down as Tactical events.
   - **Hidden Events:** Unlike tiles, Event cards are always kept secret until played.

## How to Play

Play proceeds clockwise. On your turn, follow these phases in order:

### 1. Draw Phase
Draw **1 tile** from the D. Stack, plus **1 additional tile for each Landmark** you control.

> **Underdog Rule:** The player with the **fewest Landmarks** draws **1 extra tile** at the start of their turn. (If tied for fewest, all tied players get the bonus.)

### 2. Development Phase
Place any number of tiles from your hand onto the board. Tiles must be placed:
- **Orthogonally adjacent** (not diagonal) to one of your existing tiles, OR
- In your **starting zone** if you have no tiles on the board.

#### Building a Landmark
When one of your **Housing** tiles is orthogonally adjacent to both a **Commerce** and an **Industry** tile you own, a Landmark is built:

1. **Stack** the three tiles on the Housing tile's space (Housing on top, then Commerce, then Industry).
2. The spaces vacated by Commerce and Industry become **empty** and available for development.
3. Draw **1 Event Card**, read it silently, and place it face-down in front of you.

> You may build **multiple Landmarks** in a single turn if your placement allows it. Resolve each one and draw an Event card for each.

### 3. Agent Phase
If you have a Headquarters (see below), you may **deploy**, **reassign**, and/or **execute takeovers** with your Agents.

#### Converting a Landmark to Headquarters
At any point during your turn, you may convert a Landmark into **Headquarters**:
- Flip all three tiles to their Agent side and stack them on the same space.
- This is now a Headquarters with **3 Agents**.
- ⚠️ *Warning: Headquarters do not count as Landmarks for victory!*

#### Deploying Agents
- You may move **any number of Agents** during your Agent phase.
- Each Agent may move **one space** to an adjacent empty space.
- Agents can move from Headquarters, secured tiles, or any space they currently occupy.
- Deploying from Headquarters reduces its Agent count, making it more vulnerable.

#### Securing Assets
- Place an Agent on top of any tile or Landmark you own to **secure** it.
- Secured properties require more Agents to take over.

#### Reposition
- Spend **1 Agent** to remove one of your own basic tiles from the board.
- The tile returns to your hand; the Agent is returned to the bottom of the D. Stack.
- You cannot reposition tiles that are part of a Landmark or Headquarters.

> *Made a mistake? Your agents can clear the lot for redevelopment—for a price.*

#### Hostile Takeover
To take over an adjacent rival property, you must commit **Agents equal to the target's stack height**. The outcome depends on what you're targeting:

**Basic Tiles (Housing, Commerce, or Industry):**
- Your Agents **capture** the tile — it becomes yours.
- The attacking Agents are returned to the bottom of the D. Stack.
- The captured tile stays in place, now under your control.

**Landmarks or Headquarters:**
- Hostile takeovers result in **settlement**: all attacking Agents AND the defending stack are removed and returned to the bottom of the D. Stack.
- The contested space becomes **empty**. Years of litigation, everyone loses.

**Secured Properties:**
- If the target has Agents on it, you must match the **total stack height** (tile + Agents).
- Defending Agents are always removed in a takeover.

> *Basic tiles can be seized. Landmarks and Headquarters? Those fights get ugly—and expensive.*

### 4. End of Turn
Your turn ends when you have no more actions to take or choose to pass. Play continues to the left.

## Event Cards

When you build a Landmark, you draw an Event card. There are two types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Immediate** | Must be played as soon as drawn. Follow the instructions, then discard. |
| **Tactical** | Keep face-down in front of you. Play on any of your future turns for a strategic advantage, then discard. |

You may hold any number of Tactical event cards. Keep them secret until played.

---

## End of Game

The game ends immediately when **all 64 spaces on the board are occupied**. Spaces can be occupied by:
- Basic tiles (Housing, Commerce, Industry)
- Landmarks (stacked)
- Headquarters (stacked)
- **Deployed Agents** (even without a tile beneath them)

> *Strategic note: Spreading Agents across empty spaces can force the game to end. Use this to lock in a lead—or deny opponents time to catch up.*

**Scoring:**
- Count the number of **Landmarks** each player controls.
- Headquarters do **not** count toward your score.

The player with the **most Landmarks wins**.

In case of a tie, the tied player with the most secured Landmarks wins. If still tied, the tied player with the most remaining tiles in hand wins.

## Quick Reference

| Action | Cost | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| Develop | 1 tile from hand | Expand your territory |
| Build Landmark | 3 adjacent tiles (H+C+I) | Stack tiles, free 2 spaces, draw Event |
| Establish Headquarters | 1 Landmark | Gain 3 Agents, lose the Landmark |
| Deploy Agent | 1 Agent | Move one space to adjacent empty space |
| Secure | 1 Agent | Protect a tile or Landmark |
| Reposition | 1 Agent | Remove your own tile, return it to hand |
| Takeover (Basic Tile) | Agents = stack height | Capture tile, Agents discarded |
| Takeover (Landmark/HQ) | Agents = stack height | Settlement: both sides removed |

## Tips & Tricks

**For New Tycoons:**
- Build Landmarks early. The bonus tile draw accelerates your growth.
- Don't convert to Headquarters too quickly—you need Landmarks to win.
- Use the freed spaces from Landmarks to plan your next development.
- Watch opponents' tiles—with open hands, you can see when they're one tile away from a Landmark and block them.

**Growing Your Empire:**
- Watch opponents' layouts. If they're one tile away from a Landmark, consider blocking or threatening with Agents.
- A single Agent securing a property can deter takeovers for several turns—Agents are expensive.
- Hold Tactical event cards for critical moments rather than playing them immediately.

**Corporate Warfare:**
- Calculate when to sacrifice a Landmark for Headquarters. Sometimes losing one to protect three is worth it.
- Split your Headquarters deliberately: deploying single Agents across the board creates zone control and deters expansion.
- **Capture basic tiles** instead of building from scratch—it's faster and denies opponents resources.
- The Underdog rule helps trailing players—don't let opponents stay behind intentionally.
- In the endgame, **Agents occupy spaces**. Spread them to force the game to end while you're ahead.
