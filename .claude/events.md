# Trinity — Event Cards

Event cards are drawn when a player forms a Landmark. There are two types:
- **Immediate:** Must be played as soon as drawn
- **Tactical:** Keep face-down, play on any of your future turns

## Immediate Events

| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Market Crash** | All players discard down to 3 tiles in hand |
| **Construction Boom** | Draw 3 tiles immediately |

## Design Notes

- **Immediate cards are rare** (2 types) to keep the game predictable; most events are tactical choices
- **Tactical cards reward timing** — holding for the right moment is key
- **Aggressive cards** (Eminent Domain, Hostile Acquisition, Hostile Expansion, Red Tape) are balanced by their single-target nature
- **Defensive cards** (Insurance Claim) are limited to encourage proactive play
- **Card advantage** (Insider Trading, Expedited Permits) rewards Landmark building
- **Reinforcements** creates Agents outside the normal HQ conversion — powerful but costs a tile from hand
- **Hostile Expansion** is a free capture — high value, but limited to adjacent non-secured tiles
- **Backroom Deal, Red Tape, and Hostile Rezoning** have single copies due to high impact / feel-bad potential
